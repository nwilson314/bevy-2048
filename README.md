# Bevy-2048

A simple Rust remake of the [2048 game](https://play2048.co/) using the Bevy Game Engine. Follows the tutorial in the excellent [Rust Adventure series](https://www.rustadventure.dev/).

## To Play
First you need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html). On Linux or macOS you can run:
```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

On macOS you may need to install a C compiler by running:
```
$ xcode-select --install
```

Once you have Rust and Cargo working... you're ready to go! From the root directory, type:
```
$ cargo run
```
